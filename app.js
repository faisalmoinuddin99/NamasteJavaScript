/*
The Below code is the example for Block Scope
*/

{
    var a = 10
    let b = 20
    const c = 40


}

/*
# let and const are hoisted inside sepearte memory location called Block

# And in case of var a, this is hosited in Global Scope

# That iis why, we often call let and const are block scope

# The life of let and const are only accessable inside the Block. If you try
to access let and const variable outide its scope JS will throw an error 
called not defined.
